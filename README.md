## Basic Layout  
### I want to create a dashboard for Santa to help him manage his tasks. What are the items we need to put in sidebar ?
There are a number of items that you could consider including in the sidebar of a dashboard for Santa to help him manage his tasks. Some possible options could include:  
- A calendar view: This could help Santa see what tasks he has planned for each day and make any necessary adjustments.

- A list of upcoming tasks: This could include a list of tasks that Santa needs to complete in the near future, such as gift deliveries, meetings with elves, or other important tasks.

- A list of completed tasks: This could help Santa keep track of what he has already accomplished and ensure that he doesn't forget anything.

- A list of important contacts: This could include phone numbers and addresses for important people in Santa's network, such as elves, reindeer, or other helpers.

- A map view: This could show Santa the locations of all the places he needs to visit, as well as any other relevant information, such as delivery routes or weather conditions.

- A list of resources: This could include any tools or resources that Santa needs to complete his tasks, such as lists of gift ideas or maps of the North Pole.

Overall, the specific items that you include in the sidebar of Santa's dashboard will depend on his specific needs and the tasks he needs to manage. It's important to consider what information will be most useful to him and organize it in a way that is easy for him to access and understand. 

### what are the items that needs to be in Santa's dashboard home screen?
The items that you include on the home screen of Santa's dashboard will depend on his specific needs and the tasks he needs to manage. Some possible options could include:

- A summary of upcoming tasks: This could include a list of the most important tasks that Santa needs to complete in the near future, along with any relevant details, such as deadlines or priority levels.

- A list of completed tasks: This could help Santa keep track of what he has already accomplished and ensure that he doesn't forget anything.

- A calendar view: This could show Santa his schedule for the current day or week, along with any upcoming appointments or events.

- A map view: This could show Santa the locations of all the places he needs to visit, as well as any other relevant information, such as delivery routes or weather conditions.

- A list of resources: This could include any tools or resources that Santa needs to complete his tasks, such as lists of gift ideas or maps of the North Pole.

- Notifications or alerts: This could include any important updates or messages that Santa needs to be aware of, such as changes to his schedule or issues with his tasks.

Again, the specific items that you include on the home screen of Santa's dashboard will depend on his needs and the tasks he needs to manage. It's important to consider what information will be most useful to him and organize it in a way that is easy for him to access and understand.  

## Staff Contact Info
